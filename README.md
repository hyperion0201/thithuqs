# thithuqs-remastered
This is my project, got inspirated from a project by @tiendung1510. I remastered it with React, ES6, Redux, Webpack.
### Why this?
One day, i decided to learn JavaScript, then what front-end library/framework should i choice?
Then i immediately chose with React, i thought how would it be built with React? Is it easier or harder than the static site using only HTML/CSS? 
### What i learned
-  ECMAScript 6 features (arrow functions, import and export, template literals)
- React fundamentals (Components, Props, Lifecycle,...)
- Redux (connecting components, managing states, dispatching actions)
- Webpack (building bundle file for production to optimize performance)
